{
	// The URL of the Portal server on which a Script Application environment has been installed
	// and where content will be pushed.  The value's required format is "https://<host>:<port>"
	// or "http://<host>:<port>" where https is recommended for security reasons.
	// Required for the list and push commands.  If not provided,
	// then the tool will prompt for the value.
	//
	"scriptPortletServer":"http://10.170.129.120:10039",

	// Specifies whether to accept or reject self-signed certificates when using HTTPS to
	// communicate with the Portal server.  The default value of false rejects self-signed
	// certificates.
	//
	// "laxSSL": <true|false>,

	// Specifies whether the Portal server requires authentication before executing a  command.
	// The default value of true causes the tool to require a user name and password to be
	// provided.  If the server does not require authentication, then the user name and password
	// are ignored if provided.
	//
	// "performAuth": <true|false>,

	// The name of the Portal user for authentication if the tool is challenged for credentials
	// while attempting to execute a command.  Required for all commands when -performAuth is
	// true.  If not provided, then the tool will prompt for the value.
	//
	"portalUser":"bigbangadm",

	// The password of the Portal user for authentication if the tool is challenged for credentials
	// while attempting to execute a command.  Required for all commands when -performAuth is true.
	// If not provided, then the tool will prompt for the value.  NOTE: As a security best practice
	// you should not store passwords in any configuration file.  Passwords should always be given
	// as a command line option or entered at the prompt.  The password property is presented here
	// only to provide brief documentation on its proper use
	//
	"portalPassword":"",
	
	// Specifies the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, to wait for the tool to connect
	// to the Portal server.  The default value is 15000 (15 seconds).  An error will be
	// generated if Portal does not accept the connection within this time.
	//
	// "connectTimeout": <value>,

	// Specifies the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, to wait for Portal to respond to
	// a command after a successful connection.  The default value is 15000 (15 seconds).  An
	// error will be generated if Portal does not respond to the command within this time.
	//
	"socketTimeout":60000,

	// Specifies the context of the target virtual Portal to execute the action within.
	// Required when the content resides in a virtual Portal.  Optional if the content resides
	// in the root virtual Portal or if the Portal server named by the -scriptPortletServer option
	// contains only the root virtual Portal. This option has no default value.
	// "virtualPortalContext": "<value>",

	// Path to the main HTML file of the Script Application.  The main HTML file is
	// the first file rendered by the portlet.  If -contentRoot is specified, then the HTML
	// file path must be relative to the value of -contentRoot.  When -prebuiltZIP is
	// specified the HTML file path must be relative to the top-level directory in the ZIP.
	// Required for the push command.  If not specified, then the tool attempts to locate a
	// file named either "index.html" or "index.htm" at the path specified by -contentRoot
	// or in the top-level directory of the ZIP.  If one of these files is found, then it
	// is used as the value of the main HTML file.  Otherwise the tool will prompt for the
	// value.
	//
	"mainHtmlFile":"index.html",
	
	// The WCM site area in which Script Application instances will be created.  Required by
	// the push command when -wcmContentID and -wcmContentPath are not given.  The default
	// value is "Script Portlet Library/Script Portlet Applications/" and corresponds to
	// the default site area created when the Script Application environment was installed
	// into Portal.
	//
	"wcmSiteArea":"Script Portlet Library/Script Portlet Applications/",

	// Use this option to define an alternate path for the portal context root (/wps)
	// or the content handler servlet (mycontenthandler).
	// If you do not use this option, it defaults to /wps/mycontenthandler,
	// which is correct for a default portal installation.
	// If you modified either the context root or the content handler servlet paths,
	// users of the Script Application command line tool need to provide an alternate value
	// for the contenthandlerPath parameter to ensure the connection to the portal server
	// from the client tool.  
	// For example, you would likely use just "/mycontenthandler" for an SEO optimized context.
